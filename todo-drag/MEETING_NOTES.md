# Meeting Notes

## February 6, 2024 - localStorage Implementation

### Changes Made
1. Enhanced localStorage Implementation
   - Added robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Implemented data versioning (current version: 1.0.1)
   - Added backup storage system
   - Improved data validation

### Technical Details
- Main storage key: `my-todos`
- Backup storage key: `my-todos-backup`
- Data structure includes:
  ```javascript
  {
    version: string,
    columns: {
      do: { id: string, name: string, items: Array },
      done: { id: string, name: string, items: Array },
      ignore: { id: string, name: string, items: Array },
      others: { id: string, name: string, items: Array }
    },
    lastUpdated: string (ISO date)
  }
  ```

### Features
1. **Automatic Backup**
   - Creates backup copy on each save
   - Attempts recovery from backup if main storage is corrupted

2. **Data Validation**
   - Validates column structure before saving
   - Repairs invalid data structures automatically
   - Maintains data integrity across sessions

3. **Version Control**
   - Supports data migration between versions
   - Graceful handling of version mismatches
   - Migration overlay for user feedback

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Handles JSON parsing errors
   - Recovers from corrupted states
   - Falls back to default state if recovery fails

### Persistence Behavior
- Data persists across:
  - Page refreshes
  - Browser restarts
  - Vercel deployments
  - Different devices (same browser)

### Implementation Location
- Primary implementation in `src/App.js`
- Key functions:
  - `loadInitialState()`
  - `saveToLocalStorage()`
  - `validateColumnStructure()`
  - `migrateData()`

### Next Steps
- [ ] Consider adding compression for large datasets
- [ ] Implement periodic backup cleanup
- [ ] Add user feedback for storage errors
- [ ] Consider adding export/import functionality

## February 7, 2024 - Ember Column Improvements

### Changes Made
1. Enhanced Ember Column UI/UX
   - Removed Add+ button in favor of more intuitive interactions
   - Added consistent font sizes (13px) to match other columns
   - Improved item container sizing and spacing
   - Added automatic cursor focus on new items

2. New Item Creation
   - New items now appear at the top of the list
   - Multiple ways to create new items:
     - Click empty space in Ember column
     - Press Enter while hovering over Ember column
     - Tab into Ember column
   - Automatic focus on text input when item is created

3. Empty State Handling
   - Empty items are automatically removed when:
     - Pressing Escape during editing
     - Pressing Enter with no text
     - Clicking away with no text
   - Prevents accumulation of unnamed items

4. Search Functionality
   - Added search capability to Ember column
   - Consistent with other columns' search behavior
   - Real-time filtering of items

### Technical Details
- Updated `handleAddEmberContact` for immediate focus
- Enhanced keyboard event handlers
- Improved empty state management
- Standardized styling with other columns

### Implementation Location
- Primary changes in `src/App.js`:
  - `handleAddEmberContact()`
  - `handleEmberEditComplete()`
  - Keyboard event handlers
- Style updates in `src/App.css`:
  - `.ember-item` class
  - Font sizes and spacing

### Next Steps
- [ ] Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for days editing
- [ ] Evaluate drag-and-drop between Ember and other columns
- [ ] Consider adding sorting options for Ember items
- [ ] Add visual feedback for item creation
